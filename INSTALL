HOW TO BUILD GPS RECORDER FOR MAEMO


PREREQUISITES

* git
  http://git-scm.com/
* MADDE
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/madde/
* maemo-opt (doesn't have to be in your PATH)
  https://github.com/polyvertex/maemo-opt
* Debian's tools to build .deb packages, namely dpkg-buildpackage.


COMPILATION

Fetch source code and build makefiles
  git clone https://github.com/polyvertex/gpsrecorder-n900.git
  cd gpsrecorder-n900
  mad qmake

Compile
  mad make debian-bin

Now a .deb package named gpsrecorder_*_armel.deb and its .changes file must have
been created in the parent directory. We should "optify" it:
  cd ..
  maemo-opt-deb gpsrecorder_1.3_armel.deb

You might encounter some warnings about user-defined fields, it's fine.
The .deb package is now ready to be installed on your device.
You can optionally check if your package has been optified:
  dpkg --contents gpsrecorder_1.3_armel.deb

And voila! Happy GPS recording :)


CREATE A DEBIANIZED SOURCE PACKAGE FOR THE MAEMO GARAGE (OBSOLETE)

A source package can be created as well:
  git clone https://github.com/polyvertex/gpsrecorder-n900.git gpsrecorder_1.3
  cd gpsrecorder_1.3
  mad dpkg-buildpackage -S -sa -r -us -uc -d -i -I.svn -I.git

Three files must have been created:
  gpsrecorder_1.3.tar.gz
  gpsrecorder_1.3.dsc
  gpsrecorder_1.3_source.changes

The package is now ready to be sent to the Maemo Garage
  https://garage.maemo.org/extras-assistant/index.php

Add new release number to the tracker
