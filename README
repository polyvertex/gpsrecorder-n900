GPS Recorder for Maemo

A GPS data logger for the Maemo platform.

It is written in C++, over the Qt framework and gets GPS data from Maemo's
liblocation.

Main features :
* Gather as much information as possible from the GPS subsystem at a desired
  frequency (time, satellites, fix loss, etc...).
* Export your saved tracks to KML/KMZ, GPX and/or CSV files in a single
  operation.
* Snap and name a position (POI) while recording to see it later on a map.
* Automatically update system time according to GPS time when it is accurate
  enough.
